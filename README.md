# Tableau-Superstore-Dashboard

## Overview
A project using Tableau to analyse a dataset of orders from a US based store, and create a sales overview story, experimenting with different visualizations. This was an experiment to see what kind of visualizations I could make in Tableau, and learn from experimenting, implementing colour and aesthetics into the visualization too.


## Project Goals
To experiment with Tableau, create a data story that breaks down the key traits of the dataset, implement clear visuals that represent the information well, and develop a variety of visualizations to test and assess their use case with the relevant data.
